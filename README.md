# Supermarket-Analysis-python

## Project Overview

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and analyzed using Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Data Profiling. Key tasks include data exploration, handling duplicates and missing values,  performing univariate and bivariate analyses and correlations.

## Workflow Summary

- We began by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for exploration.
- Initial steps included examining the structure of the data, checking data types, and using descriptive statistics to get a sense of the dataset.
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, Numpy

- Analyzing individual variables (features) from the dataset.
- Summary statistics and distribution plots (using Seaborn and Matplotlib) were generated for continuous and categorical variables to understand their behavior.
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

- I explored the relationships between two variables 
- Correlation matrices and scatter plots were created to visualize and quantify relationships between variables.
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

- I checked for and handled duplicated rows, ensuring data integrity.
- Missing values were addressed either through imputation or removal, depending on the variableâ€™s importance and missing percentage.
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, Numpy

- Finally, we performed a correlation analysis to discover relationships between numerical variables. A heatmap was used to visualize the strength of these relationships.
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
- **Pandas**: Used for data cleaning, manipulation, and exploration.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization library for generating plots.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization library for creating heatmaps, pairplots, etc.
- **Data Profiling**: Used for creating an in-depth data report to simplify exploration.
